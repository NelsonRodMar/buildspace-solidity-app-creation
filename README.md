### **Basic solidity contract !**

This project is a basic contract to learn Solidity.
The goal is to increase a number by using the wave() function, and only the owner of the contract can call this function
The contract is deployed on Rinkeby : [0x54D41A349a75BCa0c46c9709c5b3De2666A7A458](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x54D41A349a75BCa0c46c9709c5b3De2666A7A458)
